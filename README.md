### Understanding Xbox Gift Cards


#### Basics and Types

Xbox gift cards are digital vouchers that allow users to buy games, apps, subscriptions, and more from the Microsoft Store. These cards come in different values, like $10, $25, or $50, and can be used for specific games or services as well.


There are two main types of Xbox gift cards: physical cards purchased from retailers and digital codes bought online. Physical cards require scratching off a protective layer to reveal the code, while digital codes are instantly accessible and ready to redeem. To use an Xbox gift card, simply enter the unique code into your Xbox console or on the website.


#### How They Work

Xbox gift card codes act as virtual currency within the Xbox ecosystem. When redeemed, they add funds to your account balance, allowing purchases without the need for a credit card. These codes, created by Microsoft, consist of a mix of letters and numbers.


Redeeming an Xbox gift card is simple. Just enter the code in the designated field on your console or Xbox account online. Once applied, the funds are available for purchasing games, downloadable content, subscriptions, or renting movies through the Microsoft Store
